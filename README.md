# Project2_ColbyBio
## Project 2 for Code Boot Camp
## This is a bio page for Colby Harris
### This is my second webpage
- for this page, I combined elements of what I learned creating my first webpage with new skills. For this webpage, I learned how to use, and included
  - Flexboxes
  - CSS grids
  - Basic animations
  - webpage responsivity
    - to mouse movement over page elements
    - and to window resizing
    
| Technology | Description | Summary |
| :--------- | :---------: | :-----: |
| Flexbox    |  Used for webpage responsivity design, able to wrap on page, and separate elements easily | Flexbox was used on the header bar, and the two image bars on the top and bottom of the page |
| CSS Grid   | CSS Grid is used for making a 'layout for a page' | I should have implemented CSS grid for more of the project and used fewer flex boxes. CSS grid was used only for the body text and images, but I would have liked to have used it for the top and bottom image bars as well |
